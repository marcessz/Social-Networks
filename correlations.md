# Spearman's rank correlations of the metrics

We have normalized the average path length, maximum degree and pseudo diameter metrics before calculating the correlations as follows: 
* ```avg_path_log = avg_path_length / log(size)```
* ```max_deg_n = max_deg / (size - 1)```
* ```p_diam_log = pseudo_diam / log(size)```
